# PartnerAtStake
Implantation of a new consensus algorithm for blockchain as a semester project
CONSENSUS ALORITHOM         (Proof of Partner or Partner at Stake)
WeChat only approve a new user for joining its platform if the new user know somebody who already uses WeChat. New user has to get the recommendation of early user of WeChat for joining its platform. This was the basic idea that evolved into a consensus algorithm.
Basic Idea
There will be first (n) number of members that will join the blockChain and will be considered old and trusted members of blockChain. After that if any user wants to connect or become a member of blockChain, he will have to ask a previous member for making him his partner. If the old member choose to accept him as his partner, then the new user will be made partner off that old user and the new user will be part of the blockChain. He can make transactions after that.
